              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Vecalign

## New: Python library API (`sentalign`)

This repository now supports installation as a Python package and an in-memory API:

```bash
pip install .
```

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sentalign import sentalign

model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2")

src = ["Hallo Welt.", "Wie geht es dir?"]
tgt = ["Hello world.", "How are you?"]

result = sentalign(src, tgt, encoder=model)
print(result.overall_score)
for block in result.alignments:
    print(block.src_indices, block.tgt_indices, block.score)
```

The `encoder` argument is intentionally model-agnostic: pass any object with an
`encode(list[str]) -> 2D array` method (or a callable with the same behavior).

`overall_score` is a heuristic aggregate quality score in `[0, 1]` (higher is better),
derived from alignment costs and penalizing insertion/deletion blocks.

### Run tests and inspect English/French alignment output

A small test suite for the new in-memory API lives under `tests/`.

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pytest -q
```

To quickly see alignment output on two in-memory lists (English vs French), run:

```bash
python examples/english_french_demo.py
```

This prints per-block alignments and an overall quality score in `[0, 1]`.
For production quality embeddings, pass your own encoder model (e.g. LASER or
SentenceTransformers) to `sentalign(...)`.

Vecalign is an accurate sentence alignment algorithm which is fast even for very long documents.
In conjunction with [LASER](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER), Vecalign 
works in about 100 languages (i.e. 100^2 language pairs), 
without the need for a machine translation system or lexicon. 

Vecalign uses similarity of multilingual sentence embeddings to judge the similarity of sentences.

[image based on [this Facebook AI post](https://engineering.fb.com/ai-research/laser-multilingual-sentence-embeddings/)]

Vecalign uses an approximation to Dynamic Programming based on 
[Fast Dynamic Time Warping](https://content.iospress.com/articles/intelligent-data-analysis/ida00303)
which is linear in time and space with respect to the number of sentences being aligned.

### License 

Copyright 2019 Brian Thompson

Vecalign is released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).
For convenience, the dev and test datasets from Bleualign are provided. Bleualign is Copyright 2010 Rico Sennrich and is released under the [GNU General Public License Version 2](bleualign_data/LICENSE)

### Build Vecalign

You will need python 3.6+ with numpy and cython. You can build an environment using conda as follows:

```
# Use latest conda
conda update conda -y
# Create conda environment
conda create  --force -y --name vecalign python=3.7
# Activate new environment
source `conda info --base`/etc/profile.d/conda.sh # See: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7980
conda activate vecalign
# Install required packages
conda install -y -c anaconda cython
conda install -y -c anaconda numpy
pip install mcerp 
```

Note that Vecalign contains cython code, but there is no need to build it manually as it is compiled automatically by [pyximport](https://github.com/cython/cython/tree/master/pyximport).

### Run Vecalign (using provided embeddings)
```
./vecalign.py --alignment_max_size 8 --src bleualign_data/dev.de --tgt bleualign_data/dev.fr \
   --src_embed bleualign_data/overlaps.de bleualign_data/overlaps.de.emb  \
   --tgt_embed bleualign_data/overlaps.fr bleualign_data/overlaps.fr.emb
```

Alignments are written to stdout:
```
[0]:[0]:0.156006
[1]:[1]:0.160997
[2]:[2]:0.217155
[3]:[3]:0.361439
[4]:[4]:0.346332
[5]:[5]:0.211873
[6]:[6, 7, 8]:0.507506
[7]:[9]:0.252747
[8, 9]:[10, 11, 12]:0.139594
[10, 11]:[13]:0.273751
[12]:[14]:0.165397
[13]:[15, 16, 17]:0.436312
[14]:[18, 19, 20, 21]:0.734142
[]:[22]:0.000000
[]:[23]:0.000000
[]:[24]:0.000000
[]:[25]:0.000000
[15]:[26, 27, 28]:0.840094
...
```

The first two entries are the source and target sentence indexes for each alignment, respectively. 
The third entry in each line is the sentence alignment cost computed by Vecalign. 
Note that this cost includes normalization but does *not* include the penalties terms for containing more than one sentence. 
Note that the alignment cost is set to zero for insertions/deletions. 
Also note that the results may vary slightly due to randomness in the normalization.

To score against a gold alignment, use the "-g" flag.
Flags "-s", "-t", and "-g" can accept multiple arguments. This is primarily useful for scoring, as the output alignments will all be concatenated together in stdout. For example, to align and score the bleualign test set: 
```
./vecalign.py --alignment_max_size 8 --src bleualign_data/test*.de --tgt bleualign_data/test*.fr \
   --gold bleualign_data/test*.defr  \
   --src_embed bleualign_data/overlaps.de bleualign_data/overlaps.de.emb  \
   --tgt_embed bleualign_data/overlaps.fr bleualign_data/overlaps.fr.emb > /dev/null
```
Which should give you results that approximately match the Vecalign paper:

```

 ---------------------------------
|             |  Strict |    Lax  |
| Precision   |   0.899 |   0.985 |
| Recall      |   0.904 |   0.987 |
| F1          |   0.902 |   0.986 |
 ---------------------------------
```

Note: Run `./vecalign.py -h` for full sentence alignment usage and options. 
For stand-alone scoring against a gold reference, see [score.py](score.py)

### Embed your own documents

The Vecalign repository contains overlap and embedding files for the Bluealign dev/test files. 
This section shows how those files were made, as an example for running on new data.

Vecalign requires not only embeddings of sentences in each document, 
but also embeddings of *concatenations* of consecutive sentences.
The embeddings of multiple, consecutive sentences are needed to consider 1-many, many-1, and many-many alignments.


To create a file containing all the sentence combinations in the dev and test files from Bleualign:
```
./overlap.py -i bleualign_data/dev.fr bleualign_data/test*.fr -o bleualign_data/overlaps.fr -n 10
./overlap.py -i bleualign_data/dev.de bleualign_data/test*.de -o bleualign_data/overlaps.de -n 10
```

Note: Run `./overlap.py -h` to see full set of embedding options. 

`bleualign_data/overlaps.fr` and `bleualign_data/overlaps.de` are text files containing one or more sentences per line. 

These files must then be embedded using a multilingual sentence embedder.

We recommend the [Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations (LASER)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER) 
toolkit from Facebook, as it has strong performance and comes with a pretrained model which works well in about 100 languages. 
However, Vecalign should also work with other embedding methods as well. Embeddings should be provided as a binary file containing float32 values.

The following assumes LASER is installed and the LASER environmental variable has been set.

To embed the Bleualign files using LASER:
```
$LASER/tasks/embed/embed.sh bleualign_data/overlaps.fr bleualign_data/overlaps.fr.emb [fra]
$LASER/tasks/embed/embed.sh bleualign_data/overlaps.de bleualign_data/overlaps.de.emb [deu]
```

> Please always refer [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER/blob/main/tasks/embed/README.md) for the latest usage of this script. The usage may vary across the different versions of LASER.

Note that LASER will not overwrite an embedding file if it exsts, so you may need to run first `rm bleualign_data/overlaps.fr.emb bleualign_data/overlaps.de.emb`.

### Document Alignment

[We propose](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.483) using Vecalign to rescore document alignment candidates, 
in conjunction with candidate generation using a document embedding method that retains sentence order information.
Example code for our document embedding method is provided [here](standalone_document_embedding_demo.py).
